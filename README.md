<h1>Interactive Website Development</h1>
During this project I will begin to complete a website that allows for a user to play a game on which will test the users memory. I would like to create a game that is more than just a basic game based around a simple memory game just like simon-says. I wanted to have the game have more content that just one basic overal game. I at least want to produce a game with some form of progression and some form of variation. I want to allow for the user to be able to have a form of level and be able to have a system. Like a terrain generator and be able to generate a series of different types of terrains using a universal and versatile function to create a two dimensional array of depth to the terrain and also another function to render the terrain and produce a coloured reprosentation of the terrain within a canvas. I would like a game that can generate a sequence of characters or inputs that could test the users ability to be able to remember and reiterate the sequence back. Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript I will create a memory based game with a distinct theme and begin to make a website to hold this game which will be interactive, self-explanitory and be able to tell the user how to perform actions within the game to allow for them to reach sucess.

Within the inital production of the game I will begin by thinking of a theme that will be introudced into my website. I would like to also allow for this theme to be user friendly and also be able to be constant throughtout the webpage('s). I would would like to keep in mind of the font style as a fundemental feature as the game will be relying parcially on the presence of a text box or text output. As of unit one, I would also like to be able to set up the website with the main features at the forfront, and allow for the theme to be distint but basically colour less as the webpage I would like to create cant effect the users too much and create a gap within the audience. For example, anyone colour blind or anyone who has a visual disadvantage must still be able to play the game and have a great experience from playing.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
I start by initially create an idea or theme. I would like to try and create a memeory based game that has a form of a randomness too the game. I would like to create something that has a visual interacting with the user. I originally thought of an idea of being able to Dig Up items within a random terrain. That can be distinctly altered by choices by the user. I also would like to allow for the user to be able to upgrade something that they use during the game to show that they are progressing and that they are rewarded for most of there progression. I would also like to allow for the user to be rewarded a series of items depending on how well they may perform during the game. I would like to make a game with an idea that the user can find distinct locations on the map that they can select and click so that they may be able to harvest more valuable goods. I would alos like to allow for some of these items that they are able to obtain to be either an item for the user to use to upgrade there items or for them to see as a reward or visual representation of how well they may compelete the different mini-games.

I begin with a series of planning most of my planning takes place on both the computer in a practical workspace like this or on pen and paper. I do most the the ideas on paper as it allows for a quicker production of the webpage and also allows for you too really start to mess around with the idea. To produce an online version of the planning I then will begin to use wireframes to create a proper structured document where I can mess around with the idea further.

I would like to begin by also stating some ground rules within this produce. I must create a game for my Unit 2 project. Along with this the game must use all of the listed langauges and along with the use of these languages produce a game and website that allows for a very strong communication with the user. This can be within telling the user how to play the game, to features like resizeing, and also within showing the player some form of progression within his game. Along with these initial features that must be included. I would like to also produce something within the game that will allow for the user to be able to visually see a form of randomness. This can be through any sort of idea. Going with this concept and idea I would like to be able to produce terrain which can randomly vary in size, structure or any other feature. Along with this randomness I would also like to create a text-based companion of some form like some sort of named "Character" just to make the user feel as though they are not along on this basic game adventure but yet work with someone.

<h2>Initial Concept</h2>
I have created a wireframe with this concept. I had not had several ideas come to mind about this project and had already generally decided on the feels and looks of the website. I would generally like to try and stick to the wireframe as this would allow for me to be able to keep the idea to how I had imagined it. I didnt also want to tapper too much as this could possibly cause a clash or disliking within the features and looks of this website. I wanted to keep it very fundementally and practically strong and the styling would be set up to try and present to the user that the canvas and text box are the game and that they are the text outputs and canvas mini-games.

Coming from this idea the wireframe depicts just the general flow and a basic but effectie plan for me to understand how to program the website. I would just like to keep the plan more on the functional side of the way the website will behave and not based on the actual content that will be contained within the code. I would like to have a series of freedom when producing the tuturial text and functions on the website so that the idea can develop and continue to expand into a more detailed idea.

I would also like to make sure that I begin by developing the listeners and initiail functions needed to take feedback from the user. From this feedback I would begin to be able to produce the fundemental inputs from the user. I am going to try and set this game to the computer and pc audience as I would like to check the speed of inputs placed by the user from a keyboard and mouse. Most of the instinctive games would be set around the use of a keyabord and the ability for the user to be able to repeat a randomised string of charcters that are needed to test how accurate the user was at repeating and remembering the sequence.

Also along with this wireframe I want to be able to focus on the development of how it will function and work and how it will use user inputs to be able to create visual or text-based outputs.

<h2>Development</h2>
I would also begin by creating the usual styling that I would also produce on my webpages. I originally enable borders on some of the items within a webapge to then be able to visually see how the asset would sit whilst on the page. I like to call this skeleton-structure or bordering. I have done this whilst in college to help within the development stages to properly see how each element may be altered whiilst using the CSS styling.

I noticed that the text felt a little too close to the surrounding border within the main section. I would like to keep the border around this part of the page to allow for a text-printout vibe. As though its an old type of adventure-text game. Where a designed text-box will sit and display to the user any outputs. For a solution instead of bring the text in using padding or any other form of styling I have chosen to use the text-align property to move the text and canvas to the center of the screen. I feel as though this choice helps the user be able to read the text a little more clear and properly seperates the text from the box.

I want to begin by creating a function that is called at the correct time and allows for me to be able to obtain the users information that I need for my game to be functional. I want to wait for the mouse to be used within the webpage to be able to obtain its location. I cant to try and find the correct controlls needed to allow for the user to easily use and move around the webpage. I need to create an effect control scheme so that I can easily tell the user during a brief tutorial how to play and interactive wiht the game.

<h2>During Development</h2>
Whilst trying to initially create the website. I had produced a website that just involved the canvas. There was an issue with the text with the font of my choice not correctly working on that canvas and from this conclusion I choice to remove the text from the canvas and try to externalize the text. I dont want to change the font as my idea originated form a visual thought of a page similar to this Dig game with this font.

During production I had a few names in mind which was either dig up or dig out, or some form of dig related name. I wanted to try and just keep the name simple but effected. This name served a simple purpose for it too be a basic name that is easy to read and effective at showing the user what we are about. I rebelieve the title that I have sepected was in fact very fundementally self-explanitory, giving the user a little bit of a jokey catchy name.

Also as the idea is to create a text box I have indented and centered the text in an effect to make the text presented as though its a script or spoken piece of text for the game. I want to do this as a way to display to the user that the external text is an actual output for the users actions and any reactions from the JavaScript.

During development I noticed the idea begin to get rather ellaberate so I began to produce and create a help webpage that I filled in with any information that I felt as though would be benefactory to included about the webpage or/and the game.

Throughout development I will continue to slowly add several different functions to the application and test each one. I want to make sure that each function that is added to this game works correctly and I try to produce a series of tests. I usually use different visual outputs. I usually use the textbox as a visual outputter so I can see in what part of the function or script there may be an error or it may not be running correctly. I try and make sure that I dont do too many changes without constantly updating the webpage and checking to see if the output matches exactly what I want the webpage to do. For the beginning of production I would always use the textbox as a visual output and once the core function of the site works I then add some of the other features.

The range feature is a very helpful function that will be quiet helpful with most of the things that I am adding to this webpage. I want to make sure that data that is passed through is correctly altered and contained so that it doesnt begin to cause issues within the webpage.

For each and every test I make sure that I create a feature or function and then begin to try and find where the function has ran into an error by using the texbox print out to find the exact location where it has stopped. Then effectivly you know which parts of the script are able to run and which parts have stoppped the code/script.

Also during testing I always try and make sure that the functionality of the website is key. I want to make sure that the website will always behave as intended. This is by tracking each action and function to find if there is any issues or incorrect actions a function may be doing. I want to make sure that the foundation of the website is as strong as the overal product. Make sure that the beginning interactive-functions in the website are correct will allow for me to begin to make sure that user inputs are being tracked and used correctly. Whilst testing the draw functions I made sure that I was able to use them for a simple action like printing a blue square on the canvas.
