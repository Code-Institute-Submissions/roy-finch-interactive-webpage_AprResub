<h1>Interactive Website Development</h1>
During this project I will begin to complete a website that allows for a user to play a game on which will test the users memory. I would like to create a game that is more than just a basic game based around a simple memory game just like simon-says. I wanted to have the game have more content that just one basic overal game. I at least want to produce a game with some form of progression and some form of variation. I want to allow for the user to be able to have a form of level and be able to have a system. Like a terrain generator and be able to generate a series of different types of terrains using a universal and versatile function to create a two dimensional array of depth to the terrain and also another function to render the terrain and produce a coloured reprosentation of the terrain within a canvas. I would like a game that can generate a sequence of characters or inputs that could test the users ability to be able to remember and reiterate the sequence back. Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript I will create a memory based game with a distinct theme and begin to make a website to hold this game which will be interactive, self-explanitory and be able to tell the user how to perform actions within the game to allow for them to reach sucess.

Within the inital production of the game I will begin by thinking of a theme that will be introudced into my website. I would like to also allow for this theme to be user friendly and also be able to be constant throughtout the webpage('s). I would would like to keep in mind of the font style as a fundemental feature as the game will be relying parcially on the presence of a text box or text output. As of unit one, I would also like to be able to set up the website with the main features at the forfront, and allow for the theme to be distint but basically colour less as the webpage I would like to create cant effect the users too much and create a gap within the audience. For example, anyone colour blind or anyone who has a visual disadvantage must still be able to play the game and have a great experience from playing.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
I start by initially create an idea or theme. I would like to try and create a memeory based game that has a form of a randomness too the game. I would like to create something that has a visual interacting with the user. I originally thought of an idea of being able to Dig Up items within a random terrain. That can be distinctly altered by choices by the user. I also would like to allow for the user to be able to upgrade something that they use during the game to show that they are progressing and that they are rewarded for most of there progression. I would also like to allow for the user to be rewarded a series of items depending on how well they may perform during the game. I would like to make a game with an idea that the user can find distinct locations on the map that they can select and click so that they may be able to harvest more valuable goods. I would alos like to allow for some of these items that they are able to obtain to be either an item for the user to use to upgrade there items or for them to see as a reward or visual representation of how well they may compelete the different mini-games.
