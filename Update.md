I initially just begin by create and starting the index document and then start to create a wireframe to allow for me to show a form of flow through the webpage. I would like to produce a theme and also be able to produce a structure within the webpage that is very tidy and functional.
I then begin to add semantic tags to the webpage to try and structure the webpage in a paticular order to keep items within the page grouped together. I create a canvas and also create a title and a sub-description of what the game may be about. I have managed to come up with an idea of the use of a functions to create a random terrain that will take in specific variables depending on the users choices.
I also want to try and begin to layout the webpage with the properties in mind. I would like for this sight to possible not contain an overflow but be effective at being resized on either smaller or larger devices.
