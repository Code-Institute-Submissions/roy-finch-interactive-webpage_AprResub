I initially just begin by create and starting the index document and then start to create a wireframe to allow for me to show a form of flow through the webpage. I would like to produce a theme and also be able to produce a structure within the webpage that is very tidy and functional.
I then begin to add semantic tags to the webpage to try and structure the webpage in a paticular order to keep items within the page grouped together. I create a canvas and also create a title and a sub-description of what the game may be about. I have managed to come up with an idea of the use of a functions to create a random terrain that will take in specific variables depending on the users choices.
I also want to try and begin to layout the webpage with the properties in mind. I would like for this sight to possible not contain an overflow but be effective at being resized on either smaller or larger devices.
I have began to style to website by placing borders around the different elements to see where they are placed on the site and try to gain the functionality and structure that I want from this project. I also added the font to the webpage from the initial idea that I have had. I choice this font from the several pre-installed fonts on Windows 10 and ran the theme from this font in mind. I have also added a series of backup fonts for other computers, OS types or browsers for maximum coverage so that over users may still be diverted to a similar effective font.
Noticing the centering feature of the alignment and also noticing how close the text is to the outer border I choice to make every element on the webpage centered to prevent the text from begin to close to the outer box. I changed the header tag from begin the only centered item on the page to the whole body and children tags being centered.
I have also added a title to the website and altered the title that came with the intial setup of the webpage template.
The bordering around the header is no longer needed. I will also begin to alter and change any of the other borders that may not be neccessary anymore. Going with the theme I would like to keep the border around the text box to display to the user a feeling as though this is like a texbox from a video game.
